## Demo

check out a working demo [here](https://jkguidaven-dsa-visualizer.netlify.app/).

## Help wanted
This project is still on-going. If you want to contribute just let me know.

## Source material
I primarily used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ as my main reference when building or visualizing a data structure or algorithm. I built this project as refresher to those topics.

## Development

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). 

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
